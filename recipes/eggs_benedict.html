  <ol>
    <li>4 egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of water</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 pinch of ground white pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup of melted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Ingredients for the eggs benedict</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon of distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>8 eggs</li>
    <li>8 strips of Canadian-style bacon</li>
    <li>4 English muffins</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of softened butter</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    Directions
    <li>
      To make the Hollandaise: Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of
      water, Worcestershire sauce, and white pepper in the top of a double
      boiler over simmering water. Add melted butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a
      time, while whisking yolks constantly. If Hollandaise begins to get too
      thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all of
      the butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a
      lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.
    </li>
    <li>
      To poach the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and
      bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep
      water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip
      egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of
      water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until whites are firm and
      yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove eggs
      from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess
      water, and place onto a warm plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the
      chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a
      clotted spatula and serve.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler.
    </li>
    <li>
      To serve eggs Benedict: Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and
      top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2
      muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with
      chopped chives and serve immediately.
