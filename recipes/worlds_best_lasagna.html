  <ol>
    Directions
    <li>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a dutch oven over medium
      heat until well browned.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2
      tablespoons of parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, italian seasoning,
      fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer covered for about 1 1/2 hours while
      stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
      in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with an egg, the remaining 2
      tablespoons of parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
    <li>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch
      baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
      slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
      the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over the
      mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Cover
      with foil to prevent sticking and either spray the foil with cooking spray
      or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
      additional 25 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
